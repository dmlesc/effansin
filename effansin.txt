tcpdump
  Site: http://www.tcpdump.org/
  Documentation: http://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/tcpdump.1.html
  
  See which interfaces are available:
  # tcpdump -D
  
  Specify an interface:
  # tcpdump -i 1
  or
  # tcpdump -i eth0
  
  Disable DNS queries (-n flag)
  # tcpdump -ni 1
  
  TCP Flags
    S - SYN packet
    . - ACK packet
    R - Reset
      no connection yet = "connection refused"
      in middle of connection = "immediately throw away this connection, something has gone wrong"
    F - FIN
      connection is terminating gracefully
    U - urgent
    W/E - congestion control
    P - push
  
  BCP - Berkeley Packet Filter - extensive filtering language

    Version: 5.6.3

  Inputs
    file: reads from a file on the filesystem, much like the UNIX command tail -0F
    syslog: listens on the well-known port 514 for syslog messages and parses according to the RFC3164 format
    redis: reads from a redis server, using both redis channels and redis lists. Redis is often used as a "broker" in a centralized Logstash installation, which queues Logstash events from remote Logstash "shippers".
    beats: processes events sent by Filebeat.

Fragmentation problems can be insidious. Although path MTU discovery should
automatically resolve MTU conflicts, an administrator must occasionally intervene.
If you are using a tunneled architecture for a virtual private network, for
example, you should look at the size of the packets that are traversing the tunnel.
They are often 1,500 bytes to start with, but once the tunneling header is added,
they become 1,540 bytes or so and must be fragmented. Setting the MTU of the
link to a smaller value averts fragmentation and increases the overall performance
of the tunneled network. Consult the ifconfig man page to see how to set an interface’s
MTU.

In Ubuntu, you can run the ethtool commands from a post-up script specified in
the interface’s configuration in /etc/network/interfaces.

Joints between major population centers in the form of switches or routers can
facilitate debugging by allowing parts of the network to be isolated and debugged
separately. It’s also helpful to put joints between political and administrative domains,
for similar reasons.

We like the "shocking nonsense" approach defined by Grady Ward in an earlier
version of the PGP Passphrase FAQ:

"Shocking nonsense" means to make up a short phrase or sentence that is
both nonsensical and shocking in the culture of the user. That is, it contains
grossly obscene, racist, impossible or otherwise extreme juxtapositions of
ideas. This technique is permissible because the passphrase, by its nature, is
never revealed to anyone with sensibilities to offend.

Shocking nonsense is unlikely to be duplicated anywhere because it does
not describe a matter of fact that could be accidentally rediscovered by
someone else. The emotional evocation makes it difficult for the creator to 
forget. A mild example of such shocking nonsense might be, "Mollusks peck
my galloping genitals." The reader can undoubtedly make up many far
more shocking or entertaining examples for him or herself.

In DMTF’s own words, CIM is "a management schema...provided to establish a
common conceptual framework at the level of a fundamental topology both with
respect to classification and association, and with respect to the basic set of
classes intended to establish a common framework for a description of the managed
environment." Or whatever.

All major vendors from Microsoft to Sun are members of the DMTF. Unfortunately,
the standards they have produced demonstrate an impressive mastery of the arts 
of obfuscation and buzzword husbandry.

NetFlow tracks every connection with seven keys: source and destination IP address,
source and destination port number, protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.), type of service
(ToS), and logical interface. This metadata, combined with additional information
such as the number of packets and bytes involved, can be sent to any
suitable collector.
